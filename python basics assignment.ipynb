    "#2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "#Ans:-\n",
    "#In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages, where code is translated into machine code before execution, Python code is executed line-by-line by the interpreter.\n",
    "#How the Python Interpreter Works\n",
    "#When you run a Python script, the interpreter performs several steps:\n",
    "#Lexical Analysis: The source code is broken down into tokens, which are the smallest units of meaningful code.\n",
    "#Parsing: The tokens are analyzed to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the hierarchical structure of the code.\n",
    "#Compilation to Bytecode: The AST is compiled into bytecode, a lower-level representation of the code that is platform-independent.\n",
    "#Execution by Python Virtual Machine (PVM): The bytecode is executed by the PVM, which translates it into machine code that the computer's hardware can execute.\n",

    "#Ans:-\n",
    "#Why Lists Are Mutable:-\n",
    "#Lists are designed to be flexible and dynamic.\n",
    "#Their mutability allows for operations like adding, removing, or changing elements, making them suitable for scenarios where the data collection needs to change over time.\n",
    "#This flexibility comes at the cost of additional memory overhead and potentially slower performance due to the need to manage dynamic resizing and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Why Tuples Are Immutable:-\n",
    "#Tuples are intended to represent fixed collections of items. Their immutability ensures that the data remains constant throughout the program, providing several benefits:\n",
    "#Memory Efficiency: Tuples consume less memory than lists because they have a fixed size and do not require additional space for dynamic resizing. This makes them more efficient for storing large amounts of data.\n",
    "#Performance: The immutability of tuples allows for faster access times compared to lists, as the system can optimize operations knowing that the data will not change.\n",
    "#Hashability: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because their contents cannot change, ensuring their hash value remains constant. In contrast, lists cannot be used in this way due to their mutability. \n",
    "#Safety: Immutability prevents accidental modifications, leading to more predictable and bug-free code, especially in concurrent programming environments."
