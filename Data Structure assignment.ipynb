    "1) What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "Answer:-Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are foundational to computer science and are used in virtually every program or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Data Structures\n",
    "They can be broadly categorized into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Data Structures\n",
    "These store data in a sequence.\n",
    "Array – Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.\n",
    "Linked List – Elements (nodes) are linked using pointers.\n",
    "Stack – Last In First Out (LIFO) structure.\n",
    "Queue – First In First Out (FIFO) structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-Linear Data Structures\n",
    "These store data in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.\n",
    "Tree – Hierarchical structure with nodes (e.g., binary trees).\n",
    "Graph – Set of nodes connected by edges.\n",
    "Heap – Specialized tree used in priority queues.\n",
    "Hash Table – Key-value pairs for efficient lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Data Structures Are Important\n",
    "Efficiency:\n",
    "Choosing the right data structure can dramatically improve performance for tasks such as searching, sorting, and managing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organization:\n",
    "They help organize and store data logically, making complex tasks manageable and code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization:\n",
    "Different problems require different solutions; data structures help tailor algorithms for best-case performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Modeling:\n",
    "They allow us to represent real-world entities such as networks (with graphs), tasks (with queues or stacks), or hierarchical relationships (with trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Support:\n",
    "Many algorithms are built around specific data structures. Understanding one often requires understanding the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example\n",
    "If you want to implement an undo feature in a text editor, a stack would be the ideal data structure because it operates in a Last-In-First-Out manner — the last change made is the first to be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re learning programming or computer science, mastering data structures is essential for writing efficient and effective code."

    " 4)Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
    "Answer:-A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and is used to retrieve the associated value.\n",
    "**Internal Mechanism \n",
    "Python dictionaries use a hash table under the hood:-\n",
    "Key is hashed using Python’s built-in hash() function.\n",
    "The hash is used to compute an index in an internal array.\n",
    "The key-value pair is stored at that index.\n",

    "Answer:-\n",

    "19)Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
    "Answer:-\n",
    "Historically, Python dictionaries were unordered collections — meaning they did not maintain the insertion order of key-value pairs. This was true prior to Python 3.7.\n",
    "In versions before Python 3.7, the order in which you inserted items was not guaranteed to be preserved when you iterated over the dictionary.\n",
    "Starting with Python 3.7+, dictionaries preserve insertion order as an implementation detail (and it's officially part of the language spec as of Python 3.8).\n",
    "However, despite preserving order now, dictionaries are still conceptually unordered because they are fundamentally designed for fast key-based lookup, not order maintenance.\n",
    "***How This Affects Data Retrieval\n",
    "Key-Based Access:\n",
    "Retrieval is done using keys, not positions (like lists).\n",
    "This is very fast (average O(1) time complexity) because of the underlying hash table structure.\n",
    "**No Index-Based Access:\n",
    "You cannot do something like person[0] to get the first item.\n",
    "You must access elements by key, not by order or position.\n",
    "**No Positional Semantics:\n",
    "Even though insertion order is preserved (in newer versions), that order is not used for indexing or positional operations like in lists.\n",
    "Iteration Is Ordered (Python 3.7+)\n",
    "You can now rely on the fact that iterating over dict.items() or dict.keys() will follow the insertion order, but it's still best not to rely on this for logic unless order truly matters and is documented."
